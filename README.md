# Sha256.io

Sha256.io is a web based file hasher
that allows the user to upload a file
of any format, and get the corresponding
hash based on the algorithm they specify.
This project was originally intended to 
be a web based directory inspector with regex
but due to certain constraints, it was
repurposed.
